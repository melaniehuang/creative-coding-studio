# creative-coding-studio
Welcome to the Creative Coding studio.

In this Creative Coding studio, we will learn coding with the lens of creativity. We will be learning Javascript using a library based on Processing; a programming language made specifically for visual artists and designers. We will explore the possibilities of our designs through the disciplines of interactive art and generative design. 

As the field of Digital Media expands so does the potential of what we can imagine and create as designers. Throughout the semester, we will explore multiple methods of image making as an artistic form, interactive medium and generative system. From patterns to logos, typography to visualisations, we will explore the multitude of ways we can design with code.
