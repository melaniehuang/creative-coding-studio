## Add sound
 
♥ | Mic and/or Sound File as Input | 
--- | --- |
![](https://github.com/melaniehuang/creative-coding-studio/blob/master/course-material/images/week-09-001.png) | I've previously created a workshop to read the volume of your mic or a song to affect visuals. [Generative Sounds booklet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sAIQpIfR_o0tudW0heF3GV6y4iT_Gcn/view?usp=sharing)|

♥ | Analyse volume | 
--- | --- |
![](https://github.com/melaniehuang/creative-coding-studio/blob/master/course-material/images/week-09-002.png) | Are you more engaged with a video tutorial? We can learn more about analysing amplitude with Daniel Shiffman. [p5.js Volume Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCCHQwNAN6Y&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFcVjlDAkkGIixw70s7jpW&index=4)| 

 ♥ | Analyse your sound more closely |
--- | --- |
![](https://github.com/melaniehuang/creative-coding-studio/blob/master/course-material/images/week-09-003.png) | We can divide what the computer is hearing via an algorithm called FFT((Fast Fourier Transform). [p5.js FFT Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O3nm0Nvbi4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFcVjlDAkkGIixw70s7jpW&index=11)| 

 ♥ | Create your own sounds with code |
--- | --- |
![](https://github.com/melaniehuang/creative-coding-studio/blob/master/course-material/images/week-09-004.png) | We can make sound by coding and sequencing frequencies. [p5.js Sound Synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk8rLzzSink&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFcVjlDAkkGIixw70s7jpW&index=6) | 

## Play with pixels

 ♥ | Capture and smudge a live webcam |
--- | --- |
![](https://github.com/melaniehuang/creative-coding-studio/blob/master/course-material/images/week-09-005.png) | You will need a camera for this example but its a fun one. [11.3 Slit Scan Video - Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCJM9WIoudI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bw0bVn4M63p8TMJf3OhGy8&index=3) or [11.7 Slit Scan Video - p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqVbuMPIRwY&feature=youtu.be) *You'll need a camera for this one.* | 

 ♥ | Paint with pixels |
--- | --- |
![](https://github.com/melaniehuang/creative-coding-studio/blob/master/course-material/images/week-09-006.png) | Sample the pixel's colours and use this to paint. [10.7: Painting with Pixels - Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbX3RnlAyGU&feature=youtu.be) | 

## Add data
### Count your lyrics
Use lyrics and count the number of words
- [13.4 Word Counting - Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRlqDsuK3Is&feature=youtu.be)

### Data bubbles
Use data from a table to make different sized shapes
- [13.5: Tabular Data - Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woaR-CJEwqc&feature=youtu.be)

### Visualising the weather
Connect your data to an API online
- [10.5 Working with APIs in Javascript - p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI&feature=youtu.be)

## Add a third dimension
### Explore 3D geometries
Sick of 2D? Let's add another dimension to our shapes!
- [18.2: 3D Geometries WebGL - p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TPVoB4uQCU&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bPhi8sS1hHJ77n3zRO9FR_&t=0s&index=3)

### Adding lights and material
Let's add light and materials to our geos!
- [18.3: Light and Material - p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2FguXvqp60&feature=youtu.be)
*If you haven’t tackled 3D before, do the above exercise first.*

### Surface textures
Maybe let's put our faces on the cubes?
- [18.4 Texture - WebGL and p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1mYw-3Wl_Q&feature=youtu.be)
*If you haven’t tackled 3D before, do the above exercise first.*
*You'll need a camera for this one.*

## Level up random
### noise() > random()
Random is great but noise gives us nicer values.
- [13.1: Introduction to Perlin Noise - p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf4dIN99e2w&feature=youtu.be)
- [13.2: noise() and random() - p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcdldZ1E9gU&feature=youtu.be)

### 3D Terrain Scroller
Here's one left of centre - turn 2D coordinates into a 3D scrolling terrain like TRON!
- [Live Stream #37: 3D Terrain - Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELpZW62HGVs&feature=youtu.be)

### Walking machine
A random walker is like a drawing machine. It can step up, down, left or right randomly and create a trail.
- [Random Walker - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqecAdEGW6I&feature=youtu.be)

## Week 9 sketch
Week | Exercise |
--- | --- |
9 | Pick a tutorial you like and see how you can extend it further. Simple :) If you're finding the coding easy, focus on trying to extend it more. If you're finding the creativity easy, focus on a harder coding challenge. All I ask is that you try something you haven't done before. Also please remember to include your inspiration tutorial links as a comment. |
