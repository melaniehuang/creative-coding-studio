# Week 2: Field Trip to NGV

In week two, we will be taking a trip as a class to the National Gallery of Victoria to visit _Alexander Calder's Radical Inventor_. To read more about it before our field trip see information from the National Gallery fo Victoria below:

### Alexander Calder 5 Apr 19 – 4 Aug 19
*Alexander Calder: Radical Inventor* presents approximately one hundred sculptural and pictorial compositions made by renowned American artist Alexander Calder (1898–1976), drawn from private and museum collections in North America, including a substantial number of works lent by the Calder Foundation, New York.

Calder is widely regarded as the artist who made sculpture move, forging a practice in dialogue with the world in motion and the motion in things. His radical and pioneering methods of making art – understood both technically and conceptually – changed the course of modern art.

*Alexander Calder: Radical Inventor* introduces audiences to the full breadth of Calder’s influential career as an inventor of new artistic forms. The exhibition provides a rich overview of Calder’s extensive oeuvre, including his explorative two-dimensional studies of line and space, his three-dimensional wire portraits and circus figures, as well as his most acclaimed artistic inventions, the mobile and the stabile.

_The exhibition is curated by Elizabeth Hutton Turner, Guest Curator, and Anne Grace, Exhibition Curator at the MMFA, under the direction of Nathalie Bondil, Director General and Chief Curator of the MMFA, and Miranda Wallace, Senior Curator of International Exhibition Projects, is the NGV Curator._

_An exhibition developed, organised and circulated by the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in collaboration with the Calder Foundation._

_The exhibition and its international tour were made possible thanks to the generous support of the Terra Foundation for American Art, Major Benefactor of Alexander Calder: Radical Inventor_

Alexander Calder would be my recommendation as you have been able to experience his work at scale in real life, however if this does not interest you - please select either Sol Lewitt or MC Escher. If there is a particular artist that you are desperate to study more, please discuss with me as we may be able to accomodate. Select a single artwork to study visually and create a code sketch inspired by an element that you've seen within this artwork. Add a comment at the top of the sketch with the name of the artwork and artist.|
