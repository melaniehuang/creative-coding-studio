# Let's talk assignments

## Brief:
A museum has commissioned you to create a response to one or more artists in their major upcoming exhibition _Masters of Seeing_. The exhibition will feature the work of three individuals - sculptor Alexander Calder, graphic artist MC Escher and conceptual pioneer Sol Lewitt.

The museum is asking for visual, animated content that is inspired by key themes and ideas of either the artists’ life or work to use around the museum through print, digital and/or exhibition design. These visuals **must** be made with code as it is the desire of the curator to present a visual language both as a response to the exhibition but also one which speaks to a modern way of “seeing”.

The museum encourages both playful and experimental exploration of any treatments you see fit and are open to your concepts and personal reflections on the chosen artists’ work.

The project will be broken up into three stages for assessment:
- Task 1: Concept (30%)
- Task 2: Build (40%)
- Task 3: Final presentation (30%)

This studio will also involve a mandatory physical visit to the National Gallery of Victoria to see Alexander Calder’s exhibition in Week 2 where you will start to collect your initial inspirations.

## Task 1: Concept (30%)
Research one or more of the artists’ life and/or work to uncover and construct two clearly defined concepts for your proposed visuals.

**Mandatory items**
- Process journal documenting inspiration and ideas(500 words with accompanying images)
- Two clearly presented concepts in process journal (200 words each with accompanying images/sketches)

**Assessment criteria**

- 3 x Weekly code sketches with references in comments(20pts)
- Documentation of research and inspiration in process journal(40pts)
- 2 x Clearly defined concepts in process journal(40pts)

**Due date:** Fri 9 Aug 2019, 11pm AEST

_Reminder: No assessments will be accepted without a cover sheet_

## Task 2: Build (40%)
After a collaborative consultation with your client(slash lecturer), you will be provided with ideas and areas to explore for your deliverables. This may be a single concept, or perhaps a combination of the two for you to explore further. Your task is to expand upon your ideas in Task 1, in order to build the final visuals for the exhibition.

**Mandatory items**
- Process journal documenting inspiration and ideas(500 words with accompanying images)
- Interactive sketch demonstrating proposed final visuals

**Assessment criteria**
- 6 x weekly code sketches with references in comments(30pts)
- Interactive sketch demo(30pts)
- Process journal documenting any development or research leading to final sketch(40pts)
Please be sure to include all developments of your interactive sketch as part of this documentation
Check-in: 18 September 2019 (In class)

**Due date:** 4 October 2019, 11pm AEST

_Reminder: No assessments will be accepted without a cover sheet_

## Task 3 (30%)
Present and mock your ideas for the final visuals and how they could be used at the museum for the exhibition
- and -
Prepare a 10-minute presentation on your inspiration, process and final outputs. Use plenty of large images and tell your story. This is not meant to be a stiff or professional presentation, just a chance to share your work amongst peers. Have fun with it!

As an additional part of this assessment, each student will also be required to ask and be asked a question at the end of each presentation. This is an opportunity for the class to discover more about your inspiration and process.

**Mandatory items**
- Accompanying slides and live demo
- 10 minute presentation in front of class
- 1 answer to a question asked by a peer + 1 question for a peer’s presentation
- Final process journal and visuals

**Assessment criteria**
- Presentation (60pts)
- Answer(5pt) and question(5pt)
- Final process journal and visuals (30pts)

**Presentation:** Wed 16 + 23 Oct, 9:30am-12:30pm (In class)

**Due date:** 26 October 2019, 11pm AEST
