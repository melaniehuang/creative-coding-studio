- Presentations will require you to share your screen with the class via our Zoom classroom. 
- Each presentation will be followed with a question asked by a randomly selected student. Ask interesting questions, get curious about other student's thoughts and processes.
- Final process journal and slides will be due for submission on Sunday 1 Nov 2020, 23:00 via Canvas. Please save slides as JPG or PDF.

## Example questions:
Make your questions specific to the presentation. Don't ask generic questions that you could ask about any student's project. And try not to ask Yes/No type questions. For example:
- A big inspiration for you was Wall Drawing #63. What was it about this work that was different for you compared to LeWitt's other wall drawings?
- What was it about Kusama's work that made you want to base your project on her?
- I can see that you're using some kind of particle system in your demo, can you explain how that works?
- When you had issues with rotation in p5, how did you overcome this problem?
- You seem to have a lot of different inspirations, what is the best example of something you tried but then decided against?

## Your presentation checklist:
- Run time of 10 minutes, I will play a sound once at 8 minutes, twice at 10 minutes.
- Tell your story from the start of the semester to now, include weekly sketches if relevant.
- Present your live coding demo. Secret to live code demos? Have a video backup to show - this is good practice for documentation regardless.
- Make sure to include the things you may have tried that didnâ€™t work
- Prepare a bunch of slides with visuals to keep our creative eyes engaged - but don't just read from them. 
- Answer a question from one of your peers

## Your presentation will be marked on:
- Presentation with live demo(15pts)
- Answer to question(5pt)
- Question to peer(5pt)
- Final process journal and visuals(75pts)

## Process Journal/Project checklist
You'll notice that your final process journal and visuals is a majority of the marks for Task 3. By now we should be 8 weeks into the process of creating this final project. Let's break down the assessment with some helpful tips to make sure you haven't missed anything:
1. Research multiple sources both for your technical and creative inspiration
2. You are being marked both on the technical and creative aspect of your process and demo
3. Follow your instincts on things you've noticed and been inspired by - write them down
4. Try different coding avenues and push them further than the tutorial
5. If you're using some reference code, changing a few numbers and submitting this does not achieve a result that is unique to you, I want to see *your* process and *your* thinking
6. Keep it simple. Don't try to pad out your journal to make it appear longer with bigger words and more paragraphs. Just focus on clarity:
- What inspired you?
- What did you do?
- What did you try?
- What worked? What didn't?
