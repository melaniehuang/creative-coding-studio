# Week 3: Shapes and movement

## Shapes Glorious Shapes
There are SO many different shapes we can create.

With your experience drawing rectangles and ellipses from week 1 - give some of these 2D primitives a whirl! If you get stuck, just punch in random numbers and spot the difference! With very little knowledge of coding, you can still visually discern what the numbers and parameters may stand for.

```processing
void setup(){
  size(900,900);
  background(255);
}

void draw(){
  //line(x1, y1, x2, y2);
  line(100,100,600,100);
  
  //triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3);
  triangle(300,400,500,200,450,550);
  
  //quad(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4);
  quad(50, 450, 300, 550, 200, 700, 50, 600);
}
```

A close friend of Alexander Calder was [Joan Mir√≥](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3), a Spanish painter, sculptor, and ceramicist. Though divided by an ocean and World War II, they created continued on remarkably like-minded trajectories. And if you like one, I can guarentee you'll probably like the other ;)

Take a look at [Dog Barking at the Moon(1926)](https://www.joan-miro.net/dog-barking-at-the-moon.jsp). Take a look at how strange yet somewhat familiar the dog looks! Or take a look at [Painting(1933)](https://www.joan-miro.net/painting-1933.jsp) and look at the human figures! Or even deeper still, [Le Fermier et son epouse(The Farmer and his wife)(1936)](https://www.joan-miro.net/le-fermier-et-son-epouse.jsp) with two dancing human bodies and collection of animals.
