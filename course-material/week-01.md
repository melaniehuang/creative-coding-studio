# Week 1

## Studio introduction

### Join our Slack
Using your RMIT email address, navigate to https://cc-studio-2020.slack.com/ and sign up/join the conversation. This is where you will be able to communicate with me and each other. This is a service I use day to day for work and freelance projects so it will be the fastest way to get in touch with me, otherwise, send me an email. We will use this for our 1-1s in class.

### Download Sublime
If you have a preferred code editor, feel free to use it but for our class I will be using Sublime. [Download Sublime Text 3 here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

###  Download Chrome
We will be working in the browser so please make sure you are using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com.au/chrome/). If you don't already use this browser, please download it. If you already have this browser, please make sure it's up to date.

### Download this zip to get started
[Download this folder "my-empty-sketch"](https://github.com/melaniehuang/creative-coding-studio/tree/master/course-material/template)
This is where we'll start, locally on our machines to hopefully prevent any incompatabilities *fingers crossed*. First download the above and then we'll go into what each thing is after that.

### Join the openProcessing class
[Join the openProcessing classroom](https://www.openprocessing.org/class/64609). You will be supplied with a code to join the classroom in class. Please use an obvious name and your RMIT email when signing up. This is where we will be submitting our weekly tasks and as a result, sharing what weâ€™ve all been making.

### p5 Editor
There is an [online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) that we may have to use during class this semester depending on how your machine is handling the above process.

### Let's get to know each other
In this class I've set up 1-1s for you and I however, I'd really love to get a spirit of collaboration and inspiration amongst one another. This will happen via the openProcessing submissions but also let's kick things off with a simple exercise.

Let's break for 10 minutes and then we will come back and share with each other:
- Name
- Have you coded before?
- Something that inspired you to take this studio or inspires your practice.

## DISCOURSE: Computers and Creativity
Every best effort will be made to record and upload these in a timely matter however due to technology issues this may not always be possible. This will be a record of this portion of the class for later reference but please do not rely on these as your only source. It's best to show up to class.

## STUDIO: Starting with Shapes

### An introduction to Creative Coding
Congratulations, you have taken the dive! Welcome to the exciting world of creative coding. It is a large and ever-evolving landscape. 

It's normal to feel nervous if this is your first time coding. We will treat this class like any other studio class. We will make, experiment, discuss and evolve our ideas together AND most importantly leave noone behind. This studio is made to allow you to be as creative or as technical as you would like. So if you are on the other side and you have coded before, use this as an opportunity to explore pathways you've always wanted to expand in or revisit existing concepts differently.

We've had students make little drawing machines, sound reactive installations, body reactive visuals, machine learning experiments and my personal favourite generative art.

Some common names that you may come across are things like:
- Processing/p5.js
- openFrameworks
- vvvv
- Cinder
- Max MSP
- Pure Data

This semester we will be covering Processing; a programming language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. We will be writing with a Javascript library called p5.js and submitting our weekly sketches via openProcessing.

Maybe a table might be easier to show you how these pieces fit.

Processing | Processing.js | openProcessing | p5.js | JavaScript |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Created in 2001, as a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. It runs on your Desktop. It is a programming language based on Java. This is the OG we know and love. | Created in 2008 and has since been sidelined(works but has noone to maintain or improve it). Can run on the web. It was made to run Processing sketches in the browser. It's also used as a base to run Processing code inside of openProcessing which highlights some incompatabilities. | Created in 2009 as a method of sharing your sketches and creating an online Processing community with visuals! Runs online. Online community where you submit your sketches to a class and can upload and share your sketches. | The newest of the bunch, released in 2014 and has the most work and effort going into it currently. It runs in the browser and there is an online editor(that we may use). p5.js is a Javascript library based on Processing. | JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that runs in your browser. JavaScipt is the language - p5.js is a Javscript library. So we will be writing Javascript using the p5.js library.

Let's start coding here:

### Week 01 Exercise

Create an ode to an ode. 

We see A. Michael Noll create his homage to Picasso, Mondrian and Riley. Let's select one of Noll's artworks to recreate or perhaps an alternative Picasso, Mondrian or Riley artwork? 

Add a comment with the initial artwork/s that inspired you and why you chose that piece. 

Add comments for any other references you were inspired by. 

We want to include at least one primitive(shape) and one or more instances of the function random() on a value.
